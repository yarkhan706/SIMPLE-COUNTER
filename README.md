# Counter Web App

This is a simple web app that allows you to increase, decrease, and reset a counter value. The counter is displayed on the web page, and you can interact with it using the buttons provided.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The current value of the counter is displayed as `0`.
3. Click the "INCREASE" button to increment the counter value by `1`.
4. Click the "DECREASE" button to decrement the counter value by `1`.
5. Click the "RESET" button to reset the counter value to `0`.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the counter layout and buttons.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the counter and buttons.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file with the logic to handle button clicks and update the counter value.

## Customization

You can customize the counter's appearance by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file.
